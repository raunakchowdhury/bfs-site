          BlockchainsForSchools is closely monitoring the current situation
          regarding COVID-19. The organizers have decided to postpone making a
          decision until April 1st, as the situation for the NYC region is in
          flux. The safety of our participants and staff is our number one
          priority, and the decision made will be consistent with CDC and state
          guidelines. In the event the May hackathon is canceled, we plan to
          postpone the event to the fall.

        Blockchains4Hacks is one of the first introductory blockchain-focused
        hackathons open to high school and college students. For 24 hours,
        students will learn about ways to integrate blockchain into their
        applications, hacking away at challenges, and building applications that
        integrate those services. We plan to host workshops leading up to the
        hackathon, allowing participants to immerse themselves in blockchain
        before building their projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        In our continued commitment and support for diversity, we plan to offer
        travel reimbursements for students who are not located in NYC. We also
        plan to set funds aside specifically for hackers whose backgrounds are
        commonly underrepresented in the tech industry, in addition to low
        income students.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our hope is that students will walk away with a deeper knowledge of
        blockchain as well as firsthand experience on how to use the technology.
        We also hope that the projects created at this hackathon will blossom
        and continue even after B4H 2020 is over.

            A hackathon is a gathering where you can come together with other
            engineers, programmers, and cool people to turn your ideas into a
            real project in 24 hours. You take care of hacking, programming,
            creativity, and having a good time. We provide the venue, mentors,
            fun activities, speakers, workshops, food, friends, and almost
            everything you’ll ever need.{" "}

            There will be two categories of challenge — the General Challenges
            and the Sponsor Challenges. The General Challenges will be broken up
            into a High School and College circuit (high school teams
            participate in the High School circuit, and college teams
            participate in the College circuit); the Challenges for these
            include the Best Hack, Second Best Hack, etc. Note that to qualify
            for this Challenge, a team submission must use and elaborate on the
            blockchain component of their application. Up to $2,000 can be won
            from these Challenges!
            <br />
            <br />
            The Sponsor Challenges are challenges put forward by sponsors;
            usually these including using a sponsor’s platform (e.g.
            Ethereum/Solidity) to solve problems in an industry vertical
            (verticals include fintech, healthcare, environmentalism, etc.). Up
            to $1,000 can be won from these Challenges! You can submit to as
            many challenges as you like.

        answer={
          <span>
            We actually have three application rounds: Early, Regular, and Late!
            Each one comes with its own perks (for example, all Early applicants
            are <b>guaranteed</b> to be reimbursed up to $50). The deadlines are
            below:
            <br />
            <br />
            Early: 3/29/20
            <br />
            Regular: 4/26/20
            <br />
            Late: 5/10/20

            Absolutely nothing on your end! We provide food, swag, workspace,
            and WiFi for your entire 24 hours. Not only will we cover you for
            the weekend, <b>we can even help some people cover travel.</b>{" "}
            That’s right! Here at B4H we want to make things as accessible as
            possible for those who need it. For more info, see the FAQ below!

      <QuestionBox
        question={`Will you be offering travel reimbursements?`}
        answer={
          <span>
            <b>
              If you apply through Early, you qualify for up to $50 in travel
              reimbursement if you are outside of NYC!
            </b>
            <br />
            <br />
            Here at B4H, one of our missions is to support minorities in tech
            with their goals. While we can’t guarantee reimbursements for
            everyone if you are applying through our Regular or Late round, we
            will be offering some reimbursements. Please indicate that you need
            travel reimbursement in your application and answer the questions!
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>
              For our other application rounds, we will be considering factors
              such as family income and demographic underrepresentation, so low
              income students or underrepresented minorities are especially
              encouraged to apply. We will try to accommodate everyone with at
              least partial reimbursement if they are outside of the NYC area,
              subject to a sliding scale.{" "}

            <br />
            For high school students, we’re happy to announce we’ve partnered
            with <b>Execute Big</b> to provide travel reimbursements! Once you
            fill out the form and we determine you’re eligible, your information
            be passed on to them for consideration (if you apply through Regular
            or Late)! If you are accepted, congratulations! You’ll be covered at
            least in part by Execute Big. If you aren’t accepted, you will then
            be considered for reimbursement by our team.
            <br />
            <br />
            For college students, you will be considered for reimbursement by
            our team. Stay tuned — we’re working out a partnership for college
            student reimbursements as well!
